        <h2>6. Your Rights & Choices</h2>

        <h3>6.2 Delete Your Account</h3>
        <p>You can permanently delete your account from Settings > Delete Account. This will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove all your personal information</li>
            <li>Delete your profile picture from our servers</li>

        <h3>6.3 Opt Out of Ads</h3>
        <p>Advertisement display varies by platform:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Upgrade to MatchyTo Premium to remove all advertisements. Free users will see ads. <strong>Note:</strong> Premium subscriptions are currently only available on iOS devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Android:</strong> Ads are displayed to all users. Premium subscriptions are not available on Android at this time, so all Android users will see advertisements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also opt out of personalized ads through your device settings, though ads may still be displayed (they will just be less relevant).</p>
        <p><strong>TikTok SDK:</strong> If you wish to limit data collection by TikTok SDK, you can adjust your device's advertising preferences. However, this may affect our ability to optimize advertising campaigns.</p>

        <h3>6.4 Marketing Communications</h3>
